        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          I am a motivated software engineer with the ability to challenge
          others and myself to develop solutions to problems and situations. I
          am driven by growth within this field of work. I have shown strong
          leadership skills with an understanding of both individual and team
          goals to collaboratively work towards a common goal. My overall goal
          as a software engineer is to simplify solutions to technologyâ€™s
          complex problems and use the knowledge I already possess to keep
          improving the quality and ease of work through software. I also have
          strong organizational skills that allow efficient progression and
          division of tasks amongst my peers and myself. My objective is to
          obtain a position that will allow me to utilize and apply my
          experiences to achieve any task or goal that is set ahead of me.
